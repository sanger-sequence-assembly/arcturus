# The "loginfo" file is used to control where "cvs commit" log information is
# sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, the remainder of the line is a
# filter program that should expect log information on its standard input
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in the
# first field of this file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
#
# The filter program may use one and only one "%s" modifier (ala printf).  If
# such a "%s" is specified in the filter program, a brief title is included
# (as one argument, enclosed in single quotes) showing the relative directory
# name and listing the modified file names.
#
# For example:

DEFAULT		(echo "user: $USER"; echo %s; date; cat; echo) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog
^zoo		(echo "user: $USER"; echo %s; date; cat; echo) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog_zoo 2>&1
^snp_analysis	var=`cat`;(echo "user: $USER"; echo %s; date; echo $var; echo) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog_snp_analysis 2>&1; (echo %s updated by $USER; echo $var; echo; echo hello there) | /usr/bin/Mail jm15@sanger.ac.uk -s 'Update now available for snp_analysis project'
	


# ^zoo		(echo "user: $USER"; echo %s; date; cat; echo;  (sleep 10; cd /nfs/disk222/yeastpub/zoo/; if [ $USER != kdj ]; then cvs -q update -d; fi ; echo) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog_zoo 2>&1


# nice idea:
#   ^powmap		(echo "user: $USER"; echo %s; date; cat; echo;  (sleep 5; cd /nfs/disk222/yeastpub/people/kmr/diana.test; cvs -q update -d; gmake; echo) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog 2>&1
