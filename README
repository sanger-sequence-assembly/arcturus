ARCTURUS IN JAVA

This directory contains the Java implementation of Arcturus.

The "src" directory contains the source file hierarchy. Everything
is under src/uk/ac/sanger/arcturus and thus the base package name is
uk.ac.sanger.arcturus

The "test" directory contains the suite of test programs.

The "scripts" directory contains wrapper scripts which run the main
applications and test suites.

There is an Ant build file named build.xml which puts compiled classes
in build/classes and the main Arcturus JAR file in build/lib.

Shared JAR files are kept in /nfs/pathsoft/minerva/jars. When you run
Ant, remember to include this directory via the -lib option, as it
contains things like the JDBC drivers for MySQL and Oracle and Sun's
reference implementation of the JNDI LDAP provider.

You may find it convenient to create a soft link with a command such as

  ln -s /nfs/pathsoft/minerva/jars lib

which allows you to invoke Ant with a command such as

  ant -lib lib <target>

A NOTE ON THE WRAPPER SCRIPTS

Most of the scripts in the "scripts" directory are only six or seven lines
long. They all read the csh script fragment named setup.csh which defines
the classpath, various environment variables and other run-time options
for the Java VM.

DON'T MESS WITH SETUP.CSH

Do not alter setup.csh without careful thought. You could prevent the entire
Arcturus system from working.

WHICH VERSION OF JAVA?

The Arcturus Java classes require Java 1.4 or higher.

You also need Apache Ant in order to build everything from scratch.

WHAT'S IN THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES?

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus is the base package and contains two classes,
Arcturus, which manages global preferences, and ArcturusInstance.
All end-user programs begin by creating an ArcturusInstance object,
which enables them to create ArcturusDatabase objects for the organisms
which they wish to display, manipulate or process.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.data contains classes which represent data objects
such as reads, templates, ligations and contigs.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.database contains classes which acts as the
object persistence layer between data objects and the relational database.
The only class that end-user programs need to know about is
ArcturusDatabase.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.gui contains classes which implement the GUI
client software, called Minerva.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.test contains test programs which are not generally
intended to be part of the production Arcturus system.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.logging contains classes related to the Java logging
framework.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.scaffolding contains classes which build and
manipulate contig scaffolds.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.people contains classes which encapsulate the
identity of people involved in assembly projects.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.utils contains utility classes which do not neatly
fit anywhere else in the framework.
