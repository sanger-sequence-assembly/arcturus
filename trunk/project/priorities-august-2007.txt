ARCTURUS AND MINERVA PRIORITIES

CORE SYSTEM

Reduce the quantity of information messages generated by
the import/export scripts, so that only basic progress
information and serious errors are reported.

Fix the error messages in the import/export scripts
caused by uninitialised variables.

Develop and thoroughly test import/export wrapper scripts
for use by the finishers (via Minerva) and by the overnight
import/contig-transfer/export batch jobs.

Improve the speed and memory usage of the import/export
scripts.

Fix the tag duplication problem.

MINERVA

Collapse the repeated failure notifications in the contig
transfer UI into a single list.

Add a facility to run the import/export scripts via
Minerva.

Add a facility to run alignment tools (cross_match, nucmer
and promer) via Minerva.

Enhance the scaffolding UI to give the user greater control
and to allow scaffolding from alignments.

Continue to develop the report generator, and automate the
process via a cron job.

Add an administrator tool to add new projects and to assign
them to finishers.

LONGER TERM GOALS

Add the capability to handle new-technology data.

Add the capability to perform a directed assembly of a set
of reads (e.g. finishing reads, BAC/FOS ends, ...).
