<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Installing Minerva on
Microsoft Windows</h1>
<br>
<h2>System requirements</h2>
Minerva is a Java application.&nbsp; You will need to have Java
installed on your system.&nbsp; Minerva requires Java 5 or higher.<br>
<br>
You can find out whether you already have Java installed by opening the
Control Panel.&nbsp; If Java is already installed, there will be a
control panel icon labelled "Java".<br>
<br>
If you do not have Java on your machine, you can download Java for
Windows from the Sun Microsystems <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java
web site</a>.<br>
<br>
Please seek advice from your local Windows system administrator if you
are unsure how to do this, or if you do not have administrator
privileges on your machine.<br>
<h2>Downloading the software</h2>
You can download Minerva from the Sanger Institute internal web site as
a <a href="../../minerva.zip">Zip file</a>.<br>
<br>
Unpack the Zip file into
a convenient directory on your machine.<br>
<h2>Preparing to use Minerva</h2>
Minerva uses the Secure Shell (SSH) to login to the <code>seq1</code>
cluster to import and export Gap4 databases.<br>
<br>
You need to follow these steps to prepare Minerva to be able to use SSH.<br>
<h3>Step 1: Create the key files<br>
</h3>
Login to the <code>seq1</code> cluster and run this command from your
home directory:<br>
<br>
<code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa</code><br>
<br>
When you are prompted for a passphrase, just hit the RETURN key twice.<br>
<br>
You should see this message:<br>
<br>
<code>Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.<br>
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.<br>
</code>
<h3>Step 2: Append the public key file to your authorized_keys file<br>
</h3>
Now run this command, also from your home directory:<br>
<br>
<code>cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys</code><code></code><br>
<code></code>
<h3>Step 3: Install the private key file on your Windows machine</h3>
Login to your Windows machine.<br>
<br>
Open a command prompt window (Start --&gt; Programs --&gt; Accessories
--&gt; Command Prompt) and enter this command:<br>
<br>
<code>mkdir .ssh</code><br>
<br>
The full-stop at the start of the directory name is essential.&nbsp; Do
not omit it, otherwise Minerva will not be able to find the private key
file.<br>
<br>
The new directory should be in the <code>Documents and
Settings\&lt;Your Username&gt;</code> directory on your Windows machine.<br>
<br>
Now copy the file named <code>id_rsa</code> which you created in Step
1 on the <code>seq1</code> cluster into the <code>.ssh</code>
directory which you have just created on your Windows machine.<br>
<br>
You may find it convenient to use the Windows file manager application
to copy the file from your Unix home directory and paste it into the <code>.ssh</code>
directory on your Windows machine.<br>
<br>
Remember that the destination <code>.ssh</code> directory is <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> in your <code>My Documents</code>
directory on your Windows machine, but in the <code>Documents and
Settings\&lt;Your Username&gt;</code> directory.<br>
<h3>Step 4: Tidying up</h3>
You should now remove the files named <code>id_rsa</code> and <code>id_rsa.pub</code>
which you created in your Unix home directory in Step 1.<br>
<h2>Running Minerva</h2>
You can now run Minerva by double-clicking on the file named <code>minerva.jar</code>
which you unpacked from the Zip file.<br>
<br>
