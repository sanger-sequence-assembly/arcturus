<h1>Contig Transfers</h1>
<p>
Minerva allows you to request the transfer of contigs from one
project to another.  Each request is placed in a queue for processing.
If you have requested a contig which is in a project belonging to
someone else, then they must give their permission before the contig
can actually be transferred.
</p>
<h2>The lifecycle of a normal request</h2>
<p>
A normal contig transfer request passes through several stages.  A new
request is labelled as <strong>pending</strong>.  If the owner of the
contig gives permission for the transfer, the request's status changes to
<strong>approved</strong>.  At this point, the contig has not actually
been transferred.  It is still in its original project, but the contig's owner
or the person who made the request can now execute the request.  Executing
an approved request moves the contig into its new project.  The request's
status changes to <strong>done</strong>, and the request is closed.
</p>
<h2>Refusing a request</h2>
<p>
The owner of the contig can refuse the request if s/he needs the contig
to remain in its original project.  The status of the request changes
to <strong>refused</strong>, and the request is closed.
No further action can be taken on a closed request.
</p>
<h2>Cancelling a request</h2>
<p>
The person who made the request can cancel it at any time whilst it is
<strong>pending</strong> or <strong>approved</strong>.  The request is
removed from the queue, its status is changed to <strong>cancelled</strong>,
and it is closed, so no further action can be taken on it.
</p>
<h2>How requests can fail</h2>
<p>
It is possible for a contig transfer request to fail.  The most common
reason is that the requested contig is no longer current, and this
usually happens because the contig's original project has been imported
into Arcturus after the contig was joined or split in Gap4.  The
request's status changes to <strong>failed</strong> and the request is
closed.
</p>
<p>
A contig transfer request can sometimes be refused automatically by
Arcturus.  This may happen if two people try to request the same
contig.  The first request will be accepted, but the second request
will be refused if the first request is still active (<strong>pending</strong>
or <strong>approved</strong>).  Arcturus allows each contig to
be the subject of no more than one active request.
</p>
<h2>Contig transfers and locked projects</h2>
<p>
Arcturus will not allow a contig to be transferred into or out of a
locked project.  If you try to execute an <strong>approved</strong> request 
to or from a locked project, the transfer will not take place.  The request
remains in the <strong>approved</strong> state.  It can be executed only
when both projects have been unlocked.
</p>
<h1>Using Minerva to manage contig transfer requests</h1>
<h2>Submitting a contig transfer request</h2>
<p>

<strong>Contig</strong> menu.
</p>

</center>
<p>
The drop-down menu shows the projects into which you could transfer
the selected contigs.  In this example, you could transfer contigs
to PKN6, PKNFOS17K6 or the BIN.
</p>
<h2>Viewing your contig transfer requests</h2>
<p>
Select <strong>Show all contig transfer requests</strong> from the
<strong>File</strong> menu.  A new display opens up:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/contigtransfer2.png" width="746" height="489">
</center>
<p>
This display lists all of your active contig transfer requests.  The
table in the upper panel shows the requests that you have made, plus
any requests which other people have made to transfer contigs into
your projects.
</p>
<p>
The table in the lower panel shows requests that other people have
made for contigs in your projects.
</p>
<h2>Approving a contig transfer request</h2>
<p>
You can approve one or more pending requests by selecting the corresponding
rows in the table and clicking the right mouse button over the table.
A popup menu appears:
</p>
<center>

<p>
In this example, the selected requests can be cancelled or approved
by selecting the appropriate menu item.  If the user chooses to
approve the requests, the display changes to show the new status:
</p>
<center>

<p>
Notice that the date and time has been recorded, along with the name of
the person who approved the requests.
</p>
<h2>Executing a contig transfer request</h2>
<p>
You can execute one or more approved requests by selecting the corresponding
rows in the table and clicking the right mouse button over the table.
A popup menu appears:
</p>

<p>
Notice that it is still possible to cancel the requests at this stage.
If the user chooses to execute the requests, a confirmation dialog box
appears, giving the user one last chance to change his/her mind:

<p>
There is a short pause whilst the contigs are transferred to their
new projects.  Then the project list is updated automatically to show
the revised summary information for the projects which have been
affected by the transfers:

<p>
If any of the requests cannot be successfully executed, a new window
appears, containing details of the problem which prevented the transfer
from taking place:
