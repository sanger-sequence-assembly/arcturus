<h1>The Read Importer</h1>
<p>
In the <strong>Projects</strong> tab, choose a project and then select
the
<strong>Project</strong> menu:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/importreads1.png" height="250" width="770"></center>
<p>
When you select the <strong>Import reads into project</strong> option,
Minerva displays a new tab:
</p>
<center>

<p>
The read importer enables you to assign one or more unassembled reads
to a project. Each read is converted into a single-read contig, and
the contig is added to the project.
</p>
<h2>Specifying the reads</h2>
<p>
Read names are entered, one per line, into the <strong>Reads to import</strong>
box. Wildcards are <strong>not</strong> permitted.
</p>
<p>
Wildcards are <strong>not</strong> permitted. Each read name must
identify a
single read.
</p>
<p>
You can also import a list of read names from a file using the <strong>Open
file of read names</strong> menu option:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/importreads3.png" height="529" width="785"></center>
<h2>Specifying the project</h2>
<p>
Minerva displays a list of projects to the right of the <strong>Reads
to
import</strong> box. Use this list to select the project where you want
Minerva to put the reads.
</p>
<h2>Importing the reads</h2>
<p>
When you press the <strong>Import reads</strong> button, Minerva will
attempt to import each read in the list into the project you have
specified.
</p>
<p>
An import will fail if the read has not been loaded into Arcturus, or
if the read is already in a current contig. This includes single-read
contigs, so you cannot use the read importer to move single-read
contigs
from one project to another.
</p>
<p>
Each read is processed separately. If one read cannot be imported,
Minerva
will report the reason, and proceed to try to import the next read in
the
list.
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Reporting the results</h2>
<p>
Minerva reports the result of each attempted import in the <strong>Information</strong>
box. The example below shows the display after four reads have been
successfully
imported into a project:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/importreads4.png" height="527" width="756"></center>
<p>
The next example shows the display after the failure to import two
reads. One was already
in a contig.
</p>
<p>
The other was not known to Arcturus, perhaps because its name was
mis-spelled
or because it had not yet been loaded into Arcturus. The <a
 href="readfinder.html">Read
Finder</a> may be helpful in resolving this type of problem.

<h2>Updating the Project List and Contig List tables</h2>
<p>
When Minerva imports a set of reads into a project as single-read
contigs,
it does not update the project list or contig list tables to show the
new contigs. A future version of Minerva will update these tables
automatically, but for the present, you will need to refresh the tables
manually.
</p>
<p>
The quickest way to refresh the project list or contig list tables
is to press the <strong>F5</strong> key whilst viewing the table.<br>
</p>
<h2>Help!&nbsp; Minerva says that my read doesn't exist!</h2>
Sometimes, when you use the read importer to import a set of reads
which have just been asped, Minerva will tell you that you reads can't
be found.<br>
<br>
This is because Arcturus only checks for newly-asped reads every two
hours, and if the reads have only just been asped, they won't yet be in
Arcturus.<br>
<br>
The read loader runs every two hours during the week.&nbsp; The first
run starts at 8 a.m. and the last run starts at 4 p.m.&nbsp; Each run
takes about half an hour, depending on how many new reads have come
through for all of the sequencing projects that are currently managed
by Arcturus.<br>
