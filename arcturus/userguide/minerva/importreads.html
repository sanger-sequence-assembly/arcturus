<p>
In the <strong>Projects</strong> tab, choose a project and then select the
<strong>Project</strong> menu:

</center>
<p>
When you select the <strong>Import reads into project</strong> option,
Minerva displays a new tab:
</p>

</center>
<p>
The read importer enables you to assign one or more unassembled reads
to a project.  Each read is converted into a single-read contig, and
the contig is added to the project.
</p>

<h2>Specifying the reads</h2>
<p>
Read names are entered, one per line, into the <strong>Reads to import</strong>
box.  Wildcards are <strong>not</strong> permitted.
</p>
<p>
Wildcards are <strong>not</strong> permitted.  Each read name must identify a
single read.
</p>
<p>
You can also import a list of read names from a file using the <strong>Open
file of read names</strong> menu option:
</p>

</center>

<h2>Specifying the project</h2>
<p>
Minerva displays a list of projects to the right of the <strong>Reads to
import</strong> box.  Use this list to select the project where you want
Minerva to put the reads.
</p>

<h2>Importing the reads</h2>
<p>
When you press the <strong>Import reads</strong> button, Minerva will
attempt to import each read in the list into the project you have
specified.
</p>
<p>
An import will fail if the read has not been loaded into Arcturus, or
if the read is already in a current contig.  This includes single-read
contigs, so you cannot use the read importer to move single-read contigs
from one project to another.
</p>
<p>
Each read is processed separately.  If one read cannot be imported, Minerva
will report the reason, and proceed to try to import the next read in the
list.
<p>

<h2>Reporting the results</h2>
<p>
Minerva reports the result of each attempted import in the <strong>Information</strong>
box.  The example below shows the display after four reads have been successfully
imported into a project:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/importreads4.png" width="756" height="527" />
</center>
<p>
The next example shows the display after the failure to import two reads.  One was already
in a contig.
</p>
<p>
The other was not known to Arcturus, perhaps because its name was mis-spelled
or because it had not yet been loaded into Arcturus.  The <a href="readfinder.html">Read
Finder</a> may be helpful in resolving this type of problem.
