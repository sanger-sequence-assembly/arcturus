<h1>Introduction to Minerva</h1>
<p>
Welcome to Minerva, the graphical user interface to Arcturus.
</p>
<p>
The web pages which follow explain how to use Minerva effectively
to manage your assembly projects.
</p>
<p>
Using Minerva, you will be able to:
</p>
<ul>
<li /> View the current state of one or more projects in
any assembly.
<li /> Examine the contigs in any projec.
<li /> Search for oligo sequences in the current contigs
and/or the unassembled reads.
<li /> Query the status of any read by name.
<li /> Request the transfer of one or more unassembled reads into
a particular project.
<li /> Request the transfer of contigs between projects.
</ul>

<h2>What is a project?</h2>
<p>
In Arcturus, a project is a group of contigs which are being worked
on by a finisher.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, it's the same thing as a "split"
database, although Arcturus allows you to create new projects to
enable you to group your contigs in different ways, so you <em>could</em>
have a "split" which contains several Arcturus projects, and  Minerva will
display each project separately.
