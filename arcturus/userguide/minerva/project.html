<h1>The Project List</h1>
<p>
The project list shows all of the projects in the selected assembly:

<h2>What is a project?</h2>
<p>
In Arcturus, a project is a group of contigs which are being worked
on by a finisher.
</p>
<p>
In most cases, it's the same thing as a "split"
database, although Arcturus allows you to create new projects to
enable you to group your contigs in different ways, so you <em>could</em>
have a "split" which contains several Arcturus projects, and  Minerva will
display each project separately.

<h2>What does the table show?</h2>
<p>
The table shows the state of the assembly as it is stored
in Arcturus <em>at this moment</em>.
<dl>
<dt><strong><em>Assembly</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The name of the assembly.  This will usually be the same as the
name of the organism, but some organisms may have more than one
assembly if the source DNA has been sequenced chromosome by chromosome.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Project</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The name of the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Total length</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The total consensus sequence length of all of the contigs in
the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Contigs</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The number of contigs in the project.  This includes single
reads which have been assigned to the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Max length</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The length of the biggest contig in the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Reads</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The total number of reads in contigs in the project.  This
includes single reads which have been assigned to the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Last contig update</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The date and time of the most recent change to the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Owner</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The name of the owner of the project.  If you own any of the projects, they will be shown in <strong>bold</strong>.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Lock status</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether the project is locked, and if so, who has locked it.
Contigs cannot be moved into or out of a locked project.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h2>Sorting the rows in the table</h2>
<p>
You can sort the table by clicking on the column header which you
wish to sort, using the left mouse button.  For example, here is the
previous display after clicking on the <code>Max length</code> column
header:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/projects6.png" width="689" height="251" />
</center>
<p>
The table is now sorted in descending order of maximum contig length,
with the largest at the top.
</p>
<p>
Names are sorted alphabetically.  Numbers are sorted in decreasing order,
largest first.  Dates are sorted in reverse date order, the most recent first.
</p>
<p>
You can reverse the sorting order by holding down the SHIFT key whilst
clicking on the column header.
</p>

<h2>Altering how the information is displayed</h2>
<p>
In addition to sorting the rows of the table, you can control how
the information is displayed using options in the <strong>View</strong>
menu:
</p>

</center>

<h3>Refreshing the display</h3>
<p>
Other programs may change the contents of a project whilst you are
using Minerva.  For example, a Gap4 database may be imported into
Arcturus, or contigs may be moved from one project to another.
</p>
<p>
Minerva cannot automatically keep track of changes which are made by
other programs.
</p>
<p>
However, you can force Minerva to update the table to show the latest
situation by selecting the <strong>Refresh</strong> option.  Alternatively,
simply press the <strong>F5</strong> key at any time.
</p>

<h3>Single-read contigs</h3>
<p>
Minerva displays project summary information which includes all single
reads which have been assigned to each project.  Arcturus stores these 
reads as single-read contigs, just as Gap4 does.
</p>
<p>
You may not want to include the single-read contigs in the project summary
table.  To exclude them, select the <strong>Show contigs with more than
one read</strong> option from the <strong>View</strong> menu.  Minerva
will refresh the table, showing only contigs which contain two or more
reads..
</p>
<p>
To include the single-read contigs in the project summary table, select
the <strong>Show all contigs</strong> option.
</p>

<h3>Project and contig dates</h3>
<p>
Arcturus stores several different kinds of date and time information
about projects and contigs.  Minerva alows you to choose which kind
of date and time to display in the project summary table.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><em>Project date</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The table displays the last time that the ownership or
lock status of the project was altered.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Contig creation date</em></strong></dt>
<dd>The table displays the creation date of the newest contig in
the project.</dd>

<dt><strong><em>Contig updated date</em></strong></dt>
<dd>Each contig has an "update" date as well as a "creation" date.
When the contig is created, they are the same, but the "update"
date changes whenever the contig is moved to a different project.
The table displays the most recent "update" date of the contigs
in the project.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Most users will not need to change this aspect of the project
summary table.
</p>

<h2>What else can I do with Minerva?</h2>
<p>
The project summary table is the starting point for most of the
tools which Minerva offers.  The <strong>File</strong> menu offers
several useful options:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/projects2.png" width="689" height="251" />
</center>
<p>
So does the <strong>Project</strong> menu:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/projects4.png" width="689" height="251" />
</center>
<p>
Some options only become available when a project is selected:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/projects5.png" width="689" height="251" />
</center>
<p>
Each option opens a new tab in the organism window.  When several
tools are in use at the same time, your organism window may look
something like this:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/many-open-tabs.png" width="723" height="369" />
</center>
<p>
You can move from one tool to another by selecting the tab.
