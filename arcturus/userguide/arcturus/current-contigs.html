<h1>Current contigs</h1>
<h3>Arcturus remembers ALL of the contigs that it has ever seen<br>
</h3>
Arcturus keeps the details of <span style="font-weight: bold;">all</span>
of the contigs that have ever been loaded into it.<br>
<br>
Unlike a Gap4 database, when you join two contigs to make a new contig,
Arcturus still remembers the original two contigs.&nbsp; It marks them
in its internal database as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">parents</span>
of the new contig.<br>
<br>
If you now ask Arcturus for a list of contigs, it will show you the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">new</span> contig but not its parents.<br>
<br>
This is the idea behind the concept of <span style="font-weight: bold;">current
contigs</span>.<br>
<br>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">current contigs</span> are all of
the contigs which are <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> the
parents of other contigs.<br>
<h3><span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> displays only the
current contigs</h3>
When you use <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to
display a list of the contigs in a project, it will show <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> the current contigs.<br>
<br>
Likewise, when you use <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span>
to show summary information about the projects, such as the total
number of contigs, that information is based <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> on the current contigs.<br>
<br>
And when you use <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to
search for oligos or reads, it includes <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> the current contigs in its
search.<br>
<h3>Only current contigs can be moved between projects</h3>
The <a href="contig-transfer.html">contig transfer request </a>system
will only allow current contigs to
be moved between projects.<br>
<br>
If a contig which is the subject of a transfer request ceases to be a
current contig before the request is approved or executed, Arcturus
will mark the request as <span style="font-weight: bold;">failed</span>
and notify the requester.<br>
