<h1>Contig transfer requests</h1>
<br>
Arcturus allows contigs to be transferred from one project to another
by submitting a <span style="font-weight: bold;">contig transfer
request</span>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> provides a convenient
user interface for creating and managing contig transfer requests.<br>
<br>
The contig transfer request system is best explained with an example.<br>
<h3>The background<br>
</h3>
Alice and Bob are finishers who are working on the same assembly, but
on different projects.<br>
<br>
Alice's project is called CLONEA and Bob's project is called CLONEB.<br>
<br>
Bob discovers that Alice's project contains a contig which he needs to
make a join in his project.<br>
<br>
The contig is identified by its unique ID number, 1234.<br>
<h3>Bob creates a contig transfer request<br>
</h3>
Bob used <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to submit a
contig transfer request to move contig 1234 from project CLONEA to
project CLONEB.<br>
<br>
Arcturus automatically sends an email to Alice to tell her about Bob's
request.<br>
<h3>Alice reviews the request</h3>
Alice uses <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to review
the details of the request.<br>
<br>
At this stage, contig 1234 is still in Alice's project, and Bob cannot
acquire it without Alice's consent.<br>
<h3>Scenario 1 : Alice refuses the request<br>
</h3>
If Alice decides that she needs contig 1234, she uses <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">refuse</span> the request.<br>
<br>
Arcturus sends Bob an email to inform him that his request has been
turned down, and contig 1234 remains in Alice's project.<br>
<h3>Scenario 2 : Alice agrees to the request</h3>
If Alice decides that she doesn't need contig 1234, she uses <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">approve</span> the request.<br>
<br>
Arcturus sends Bob an email to tell him that his request has been
approved.<br>
<br>
At this stage, contig 1234 is still in Alice's project, but either Bob
or Alice can now use <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span>
to <span style="font-weight: bold;">execute</span> the request.<br>
<h3>Bob executes the request</h3>
Bob uses <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to execute
the request.&nbsp; Provided that both projects are unlocked, Arcturus
moves contig 1234 from Alice's project to Bob's project, and sends an
email to Alice to tell her that the contig is no longer in her project.<br>
<h3>Contigs cannot be moved out of or into a locked project<br>
</h3>
If either project is locked when Bob tries to execute the request,
Arcturus leaves the contig in Alice's project, and notifies Bob to try
to execute the request again later.<br>
<h3>Contig transfers to and from the BIN</h3>
The BIN project can never be owned by anyone.&nbsp; If Bob wants to
move a contig from the BIN into his project, or from his project into
the BIN, he must still submit a contig transfer request, but can
approve the request himself and then execute it.<br>
<br>
This is also true for other projects which do not have an owner.<br>
<h3>Contig transfers between two projects owned by the same person</h3>
If Bob wishes to transfer a contig from one of his projects to another
of his projects, he must still submit a contig transfer request, but,
as with transfers to or from the BIN or other unowned projects, Bob can
approve his own request.<br>
<h3>What happens when someone is on holiday?</h3>
Suppose that Alice has just gone away on holiday for two weeks when Bob
submits his request for contig 1234.&nbsp; Bob can't continue to work
on his project without contig 1234.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Arcturus allows project coordinators and team leaders to
approve contig transfer requests involving any assembly for which they
are responsible.&nbsp; They can even unlock someone else's project to
allow a contig transfer to be executed.<br>
<br>
Bob explains the situation to his team leader, and if she is satisfied
that Alice would have approved the request, she approves it on Alice's
behalf.&nbsp; Arcturus notifies Alice that the request has been
approved in her absence, and Bob executes the request in the usual way.<br>
<h3>Contig transfers can sometimes fail</h3>
Occasionally, Arcturus itself will refuse to allow a contig transfer
request to be approved or to be executed.<br>
<br>
This can happen if the requested contig has ceased to be a <a
 href="current-contigs.html">current contig</a>, because Arcturus
does not allow old contigs to be transferred.<br>
<br>
It can also happen if the requested contig has been moved out of its
original project by another user.&nbsp; This is a very unusual
situation
which should not occur under normal circumstances, but if finisher
Chris somehow manages to move contig 1234 into his project, then when
Alice tries to approve the request or Bob tries to execute it, Arcturus
detects that the contig is no longer in Alice's project.&nbsp; This
renders
the request invalid, and Arcturus marks it as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">failed</span> and notifies both Alice and
Bob by email.<br>
