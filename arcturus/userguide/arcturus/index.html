<h1>Introduction to Arcturus</h1>
This document introduces you to the Arcturus system and gives brief
answers to the following questions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>What is Arcturus?</li>
  <li>What does it do?</li>
  <li>How do we use it?</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Arcturus?</h2>
Arcturus is a software system which was developed in the Pathogen
Sequencing Unit (PSU) of the Sanger Institute to manage eukaryotic
whole-genome
sequencing projects.&nbsp; It was initially created to support the
sequencing of protozoan parasites such as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Leishmania</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Trypanosoma</span> and helminths such as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Schistosoma</span>, but it is now also
routinely used in bacterial sequencing projects.<br>
<br>
Arcturus uses a relational database system to store information about
read
sequences and contigs.<br>
<br>
Contigs can be exported from Arcturus to a Gap4 database for editing,
and Gap4 databases can be imported into Arcturus.<br>
<br>
Arcturus maintains information about successive "generations" of
contigs throughout the lifetime of a sequencing project.<br>
<br>
Users interact with Arcturus using a front-end software package called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span>.<br>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcturus
allows several finishers to work together on the same sequencing
project.</span><br>
<br>
Arcturus groups contigs into sets called projects.&nbsp; Each project
may correspond to a chromosome, or a clone, or any region of the genome
which is being worked on by a finisher.<br>
<br>
Each project has a named owner who can control the contigs which it
contains.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcturus gives annotators access to
unfinished sequence at an early stage.</span><br>
<br>
Annotators are encouraged to begin analysing a new genome as soon as
contigs become available from the shotgun assembly.&nbsp; In the past,
this has led to problems later in the lifetime of the sequencing
project when preliminary annotations had to be re-mapped to contigs at
a more advanced stage of finishing.<br>
<br>
Arcturus avoids such problems by automatically re-mapping annotations
to each new generation of contigs as they are imported.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcturus maintains a complete history
of a
sequencing project.</span><br>
<br>
Arcturus retains information about all of the contigs that are
imported, from the very first shotgun assembly to the finished genome.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcturus gives each contig a unique
identification code.</span><br>
<br>
Gap4 contig names are not unique or permanent.&nbsp; They cannot be
used to identify a contig over the lifetime of a sequencing
project.&nbsp; This has led to major problems, such as when external
collaborators identify a gene of interest in a particular contig in a
public data release, then return to it many months later, and ask us
about the contig using its Gap4 name.&nbsp; It may be difficult, or
even impossible, to identify the correct contig, since Gap4 names are
transient.<br>
<br>
Arcturus solves this problem by assigning a unique and permanent
identification code to every contig.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arcturus provides finishers,
annotators and
project managers with useful tools.</span><br>
<br>
Finishers can search for specific reads or oligo sequences within their
projects, carry out directed assemblies of finishing reads, construct
and display scaffolds of contigs linked by pUC bridges, and transfer
contigs between projects.<br>
<br>
Annotators can export contigs in EMBL or FASTA format and examine the
history of specific annotations.<br>
<br>
Project managers can track the progress of a sequencing project at
several levels, from individual projects to the entire genome.&nbsp;
They can also assign projects to finishers.<br>
<h2>How do we use it?</h2>
You will normally interact with Arcturus via a front-end software
package called <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> which
allows you to manage your projects and contigs through an easy-to-use
program which runs on your desktop or laptop.<br>
