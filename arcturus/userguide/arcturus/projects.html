<h1>What is a project?</h1>
<br>
Arcturus organises an assembly by grouping sets of contigs into
projects.<br>
<br>
A project is often a set of contigs from a single chromosome or from a
specific clone, but in practice, a project can contain any set of
contigs that you need to group together, for whatever reason.<br>
<h2>Ownership of a project<br>
</h2>
A project can be assigned to a specific finisher, who is said to be the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">owner</span> of the project.<br>
<br>
Ownership of an Arcturus project confers control over that project and
the contigs which it contains.<br>
<br>
The owner can <span style="font-weight: bold;">lock</span> the project
to prevent other people from making changes to it.<br>
<br>
Some software, such as the assembly pipeline, can also lock a project
to prevent it from being changed whilst a critical operation is in
progress.<br>
<h2>The BIN project<br>
</h2>
Every assembly has a special project named <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">BIN</span>, which contains
all of the contigs that have not been assigned to a chromosome or clone.<br>
<br>
During the initial shotgun stage, the BIN is often the only project,
and all new contigs will be put into it.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Contigs are also put into the BIN by the assembly pipeline if they
cannot be linked to the project for a particular chromosome or clone.<br>
<br>
The BIN does not have an owner.<br>
<h2>Projects and Gap4 databases<br>
</h2>
A project often corresponds to a Gap4 database.<br>
<br>
Arcturus provides a convenient way (via the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> user interface) to export
the contigs in an Arcturus project to a Gap4 database and to import
contigs from a Gap4 database into an Arcturus project.<br>
<br>
Whilst a project is exported as a Gap4 database, Arcturus automatically
locks the project to prevent other users or programs from changing the
contigs in the project.&nbsp; When the Gap4 database is imported back
into Arcturus, the lock is removed.<br>
<h2>Moving contigs between projects<br>
</h2>
Contigs can be moved from one project to another by submitting a <a
 href="contig-transfer.html">contig
transfer request</a> via <span style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span>.<br>
