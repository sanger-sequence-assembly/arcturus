ARCTURUS IN JAVA

This directory contains the Java implementation of Arcturus.

The "src" directory contains the source file hierarchy. Everything
is under src/uk/ac/sanger/arcturus and thus the base package name is
uk.ac.sanger.arcturus

The "test" directory contains the suite of test programs.

The "scripts" directory contains wrapper scripts which run the main
applications and test suites.

There is an Ant build file named build.xml which puts compiled classes
in build/classes and the main Arcturus JAR file in the top-level directory.

REQUIRED JAR FILES

Arcturus currently requires the following external JAR files:

  * The MySQL JDBC library.
  
  * The Oracle JDBC library.
  
  * The Java Look-and-Feel Graphics Repository library.
  
  * The JavaMail library.
  
  * The Java Activation Framework library (used by JavaMail).

They are kept in the "lib" sub-directory.  The manifest file for
the Arcturus JAR file expects them to be in this location.

You should invoke Ant with a command such as

  ant -lib lib <target>

A NOTE ON THE WRAPPER SCRIPTS

Most of the scripts in the "scripts" directory are only six or seven lines
long. They all read the csh script fragment named setup.csh which defines
the classpath, various environment variables and other run-time options
for the Java VM.

DON'T MESS WITH SETUP.CSH

Do not alter setup.csh without careful thought. You could prevent the entire
Arcturus system from working.

WHICH VERSION OF JAVA?

The Arcturus Java classes require Java 1.4 or higher.

You also need Apache Ant in order to build everything from scratch.

WHAT'S IN THE DIFFERENT PACKAGES?

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus is the base package and contains two classes,
Arcturus, which manages global preferences, and ArcturusInstance.
All end-user programs begin by creating an ArcturusInstance object,
which enables them to create ArcturusDatabase objects for the organisms
which they wish to display, manipulate or process.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.data contains classes which represent data objects
such as reads, templates, ligations and contigs.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.database contains classes which acts as the
object persistence layer between data objects and the relational database.
The only class that end-user programs need to know about is
ArcturusDatabase.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.pooledconnection contains classes which implement
a simple connection pool, which ArcturusDatabase objects can use to
acquire connections to the relational database.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.gui contains classes which implement the GUI
client software, called Minerva.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.test contains test programs which are not generally
intended to be part of the production Arcturus system.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.logging contains classes related to the Java logging
framework.  These include handlers which can log errors to a database,
email a report to a user, and display a warning dialog on the screen.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.scaffolding contains classes which build and
manipulate contig scaffolds.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.people contains classes which encapsulate the
identity of people involved in assembly projects.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.oligo contains a package which can be used to
search reads and contigs for oligo sequences.

uk.ac.sanger.arcturus.utils contains utility classes which do not neatly
fit anywhere else in the framework.
