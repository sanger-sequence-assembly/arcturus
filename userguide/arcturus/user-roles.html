<h1>User roles</h1>
<br>
Arcturus recognises several different types of user, which are called
roles.<br>
<br>
Arcturus grants different capabilities to each role.<br>
<br>
Each sequencing project has its own list of users and their roles, so
some people may have more than one role if they are involved in several
sequencing projects.<br>
<h3>Finisher</h3>
The most fundamental role is <span style="font-weight: bold;">finisher</span>.&nbsp;
A user in this role can<br>
<ul>
  <li>own one or more projects</li>
  <li>create a new project<br>
  </li>
  <li>export contigs from a project which she owns to a Gap4 database</li>
  <li>import contigs from a Gap4 database into a project which she owns</li>
  <li>submit a contig transfer request to move a contig to or from a
project which she owns</li>
  <li>approve another user's contig transfer request for a contig in a
project which she owns</li>
  <li>lock a project which she owns, to prevent anyone else from
altering it</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project coordinator</h3>
A <span style="font-weight: bold;">project coordinator</span> can do
all of the things which a finisher can do, and in addition, can<br>
<ul>
  <li>approve a contig transfer request on behalf of another user</li>
  <li>change the ownership of a project</li>
</ul>
<h3>Team leader</h3>
The <span style="font-weight: bold;">team leader</span> role
corresponds to the Sanger Institute job title.&nbsp; In Arcturus, a
team leader has essentially the same capabilities as a project
coordinator.<br>
<h3>Administrator</h3>
An <span style="font-weight: bold;">administrator</span> has complete
control over the entire Arcturus system and can intervene to fix
problems and perform tasks which cannot be carried out using <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span>.<br>
<h3>Annotator</h3>
An <span style="font-weight: bold;">annotator</span> has a read-only
view of the contigs in an assembly.&nbsp; She can use <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Minerva</span> to view an assembly and to
export contig consensus sequences in FASTA or EMBL format, but cannot
alter the contigs in any way.<br>
