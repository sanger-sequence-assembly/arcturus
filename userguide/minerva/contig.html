<h1>The Contig List</h1>
<p>
In the <strong>Projects</strong> tab, choose a project in the
table and then select the <strong>File</strong> menu:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/projects7.png" width="689" height="251" />
</center>
</p>
<p>
When you select the <strong>Open selected project</strong> option,
Minerva displays a new table:
</p>
<center>
<img src="screenshots/contigs1.png" width="654" height="459" />
</center>
<p>
This table lists all of the contigs which are currently in the
project that you selected.
</p>
<p>
When the table is first displayed, the contigs are sorted from
largest to smallest, but you can click on the column header to
sort the contigs in a different order.  Hold down the SHIFT key
whilst clicking on the column header to reverse the order.
</p>

<h2>What does the table show?</h2>
<p>
The table shows information about all of the contigs in the selected
project, as it is stored in Arcturus <em>at this moment</em>.
</p>

<h3>Refreshing the display</h3>
<p>
Other programs may change the contents of a project whilst you are
using Minerva.  For example, a Gap4 database may be imported into
Arcturus, or contigs may be moved from one project to another.
</p>
<p>
Minerva cannot automatically keep track of changes which are made by
other programs.
</p>
<p>
However, you can force Minerva to update the table to show the latest
situation by selecting the <strong>Refresh</strong> option in the
</strong>View</strong> menu.  Alternatively, simply press the
<strong>F5</strong> key at any time.
</p>

<h3>What is the contig ID?</h3>
<p>
Arcturus identifies every contig by a unique ID number.  Remember
that Arcturus stores information about all of the contigs that
have ever existed in an assembly, so a contig's Gap4 name may
not be unique.  This makes the Gap4 name a very unreliable way to
identify a contig.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Arcturus assigns a unique ID number to every new contig
which is imported.  Minerva displays this number in the column
labelled <strong>ID</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Why does Minerva show the Gap4 name?</h3>
<p>
Gap4 does not yet understand Arcturus ID numbers, so Minerva also
displays the Gap4 name of the contig to enable you to use Gap4
and Minerva side by side.
