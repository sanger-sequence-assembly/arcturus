MINERVA STATUS AND PRIORITIES, JULY 2007

CURRENT STATUS

The first release of Minerva was announced on 4 March 2007.

Minerva is designed to be run on desktop Linux machines, although
it can also run under Windows since it is written in Java and does
not need to access any Unix filesystems.

Minerva currently allows users to perform the following tasks:

-- Display a list of projects (splits) for an assembly

-- Display a list of contigs in a given project (split)

-- Import free reads into a project

-- Find oligo sequences in the contig consensuses and free reads

-- Find out which contig (if any) a list of named reads are currently in

-- Export contigs as FASTA or CAF files

-- Submit contig transfer requests

-- Approve, refuse and execute contig transfer requests

The latter two features are not yet in widespread use, because they
assume that a complete import/export cycle will be performed every
night to fulfil contig transfer requests.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The members of teams 21 and 23 were canvassed to seek their views on
which new features would be most useful to them.  They listed the
following features as their top priorities:

-- Display a scaffold based on a particular contig

-- Run the project Arcturus <--> Gap4 import and export scripts

-- Run an incremental assembly on a project

-- Run cross_match on contigs and free reads, to look for overlaps

This feature has been flagged as a high priority by team leaders and
project managers:

-- Display a statistical summary of the contigs in an entire assembly

These features were also proposed, but the finishing teams assigned them
a lower priority:

-- Display a contig's "ancestors" i.e. the contigs that were joined (or
   split) to make this contig

-- Create new projects

-- Change the owner of a project (for team leaders)
