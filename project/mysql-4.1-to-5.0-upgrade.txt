MySQL 4.1 to 5.0 upgrade plan
-----------------------------

PHASE 1: Renaming READS table to READINFO
-------

1. Check all pending changes into CVS.

2. Create a CVS tag: Before_MySQL_4_to_5_upgrade

3. Check out a full copy of Arcturus to /nfs/arcturus2/migration

4. Change the names of all READS tables to READINFO on the v4.1
   master instance.

5. Change all occurrences of READS to READINFO in the CVS check-out
   in /nfs/arcturus2/migration

   adh: sql,java sub-directories
   ejz: lib,utils,test sub-directories

6. Create a test database by duplicating PKN or CPARA on the v4.1
   master instance, and create an LDAP entry for it.

7. Test scripts and programs in the /nfs/arcturus2/migration
   CVS check-out, using the test database created in the previous
   step.

   adh: consensus program
        scaffolding script
        Minerva

   ejz: read-loader script
        duplicate-reads detection script
        CAF import and export scripts

   Correct any errors that are found.

8. When all tests have been passed, commit the changes in
   /nfs/arcturus2/migration back into CVS.

9  Create a CVS tag: After_MySQL_4_to_5_upgrade


PHASE 2: Migrating from MySQL 4.1 to MySQL 5.0
-------

BEFORE MIGRATION DAY

1. Set up and test MySQL 5.0 replication.

ON MIGRATION DAY

1. Remove all test databases from the v5.0 instance.

2. Shut down the v5.0 replication instance.

3. Switch off replication on the v5.0 master instance and purge
   all binary log files.

4. Copy all active databases from the v4.1 master instance to
   the v5.0 master instance using the mysqldump|mysql pipeline.

5. Shut down the v5.0 master instance.

6. Swap the v4.1 directories with the v5.0 directories on both the
   master and replication instances.

7. Edit the v5.0 configuration files and the startup and shutdown
   scripts to correct all absolute paths, to restore binary
   logging and to change the TCP/IP port numbers.

8. Change the "mysql" symbolic link to point to the v5.0 installation.

9. Copy the v5.0 master data directory to the v5.0 replication
   instance.

10. Remove all replication files from the v5.0 master and replication
    instances.

11. Start the v5.0 master instance and check that binary logging is
    working correctly.

12. Start the v5.0 replication instance and check that replication
    is working correctly.

13. Run tests on the test database, as in Phase 1, step 7.

14. When all tests have been passed, notify all users that Arcturus
    is available again.
