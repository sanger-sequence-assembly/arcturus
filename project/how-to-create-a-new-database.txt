CREATING A NEW ARCTURUS DATABASE

These are the steps which must be followed in order to add a new
assembly to Arcturus.

STAGE 1

1. Login to the MySQL server as root.

2. Create a new database.

3. Create the tables in the database.  The easiest way to do this
   is by using the "CREATE TABLE ... LIKE ..." syntax, with an
   existing database as a template.

4. Grant the appropriate privileges on the new database to the MySQL
   users "arcturus" and "arcturus_dba".  Again, the easiest way to
   do this is by copying the privileges from an existing database.

STAGE 2

1. Login to the MySQL server as arcturus_dba.

2. Load the views from <arcturus_home>/sql/views/*.sql

3. Load the stored procedures from <arcturus_home>/sql/procedures/*.sql

   The easiest way to perform steps 2 and 3 is with a command such
   as

     cd <arcturus_home>/sql
     cat views/*.sql procedures/*.sql | mysql -u arcturus_dba ...

4. Create a new entry in the ASSEMBLY table.

5. Create a new entry in the PROJECT table for the BIN project.

6. Populate the USER and PRIVILEGE tables.  The easiest way to do this
   is to use an existing database as a template, and copy the entries
   from its USER and PRIVILEGE tables.

STAGE 3

1. Login to the LDAP server (using the JXplorer tool) as the Arcturus
   administrator user i.e. a user with write access to the Arcturus
   sub-tree. 

2. Create a new entry in the cn=pathogen,cn=jdbc tree for the MySQL
   database that has just been created.  The easiest way to do this is
   to modify an entry in the cn=tmp,cn=jdbc tree, and then copy and paste
   it into cn=pathogen,cn=jdbc.

3. Create an alias for the new entry in the appropriate sub-tree e.g.
   bacteria, fungi, etc.
