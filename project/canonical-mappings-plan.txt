Implementing canonical mappings in Arcturus
-------------------------------------------

1. Define the new mapping and segment objects and their relationship
   to the existing objects.


2. Define the changes to be made to the database schema.


3. Create a script which will

   * Create the new tables.

   * Populate the new tables from the existing data.

   * Update the schema.

   The script also should be capable of reverting the schema.


4. Create a test database from one of the currently active organisms,
   using the script from stage 3.


5. Determine the changes which will need to be made to the core algorithms
   and classes, with particular reference to the contig parent-child
   recognition algorithm and the export routines.


6. Determine the changes which will need to be made to the Java codebase,
   with particular reference to the consensus calculation classes and the
   scaffold-builder classes.


7. Create a Subversion branch for the development of the code, and ensure
   that working copies are clearly recognisable as from that branch.


8. Implement and thoroughly test the changes to the core system.


9. Implement and thoroughly test the changes to the Java codebase.


10. Define and test a procedure for rolling out the changes to the database
    schemas and the software.


11. Draft a timetable for the rollout and consult with all users to get
    their approval.


12. Implement the rollout.
